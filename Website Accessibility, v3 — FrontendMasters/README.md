## Course Review

The Frontend Masters Web Accessibility v3 workshop provided an invaluable learning experience in the realm of web
accessibility. The course content was well-structured, covering a wide range of topics from the basics of accessibility
standards to hands-on debugging techniques.

One of the highlights of the workshop was the practical approach to understanding how screen readers and other assistive
technologies work. The instructor's guidance in identifying and addressing accessibility issues in both code and design
was instrumental in building a solid foundation.

The emphasis on creating accessible interactive UIs using HTML, ARIA, and effective keyboard focus management was
particularly enlightening. The course not only addressed the importance of web accessibility but also equipped
participants with the skills needed to implement and audit accessibility in any web project.

In conclusion, the Frontend Masters Web Accessibility v3 workshop is a must for developers and designers seeking to
create inclusive web experiences. The knowledge gained from this workshop goes beyond compliance, empowering
participants to contribute to a more accessible and user-friendly web.
